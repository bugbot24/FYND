<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">Application of JavaScript Programming</h3>
<p  style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;" > As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages (Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
<li>Client side validation - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.</li>
<li> Manipulating HTML Pages - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.</li>
<li>User Notifications - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.</li>
<li>Back-end Data Loading - Javascript provides Ajax library which helps in loading back-end data while you are doing some other processing. This really gives an amazing experience to your website visitors </li>
<li> Presentations - JavaScript also provides the facility of creating presentations which gives website look and feel. JavaScript provides RevealJS and BespokeJS libraries to build a web-based slide presentations.</li>
<li> Server Applications - Node JS is built on Chrome's Javascript runtime for building fast and scalable network applications. This is an event based library which helps in developing very sophisticated server applications including Web Servers. </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;" >JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. <br> 
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.  </p>
 
    <ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
     <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.</li>
    <li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>
    <li>Complementary to and integrated with Java.</li>
    <li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML.</li>
    <li>Open and cross-platform</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Client-Side JavaScript</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;"> Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.
    It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.
    The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.
    The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.
     JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly
</p>

<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> Advantages of JavaScript</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; ;">The merits of using Javascript are -</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
<li> Less server interaction − You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server</li>
<li>Immediate feedback to the visitors − They don't have to wait for a page reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something. </li>
<li>Increased interactivity − You can create interfaces that react when the user hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard. </li>
<li> Richer interfaces − You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-and-drop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.</li> 
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; ;">Limitations of  Javascript</h3>
<ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
<li>Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has been kept for security reason.</li>
<li>JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such support available. </li>
<li>JavaScript doesn't have any multi-threading or multiprocessor capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Javascript Variables</h3>
<ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Variables in JavaScript are simply names of storage locations. In other words, they can be considered as stand-in values that we can use to perform various operations in our JavaScript codes. JavaScript allows the usage of variables in the following three ways:</p>
  <li> <b>var</b>: The most commonly used variable in JavaScript is var. It can be redeclared and its value can be reassigned, but only inside the context of a function. When the JavaScript code is run, variables defined using var are moved to the top. An example of a variable declared using the "var" keyword in JavaScript is shown below:  var x = 140; //  variable x can be reassigned a new value and also redeclared</li>
   <li> <b>const</b>: const variables in JavaScript cannot be used before they appear in the code. They can neither be reassigned values, that is, their value remains fixed throughout the execution of the code, nor can they be redeclared. An example of a variable declared using the "const" keyword in JavaScript is shown below:
    const x = 5; // variable x cannot be reassigned a new value or redeclared </li>

    <li><b>let</b>: The let variable, like const, cannot be redeclared. But they can be reassigned a value. An example of a variable declared using the "let" keyword in JavaScript is shown below:
let x = 202; // variable x cannot be redeclared but can be reassigned a new value</li>
</ul> 
<hr>
<h3 tyle="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Javascript Data Types</h3>
<ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">Different types of values and data can be stored in JavaScript variables. To assign values to JavaScript variables, you use the equals to "=" sign operator. The various data types in JavaScript are as follows:</p>
<li>Numbers: These are just numerical values. They can be real numbers or integers. An example of the numbers data type is shown below: var id = 100</li>
<li>
    Variables: The variable data type, as the name suggests, does not have a fixed value. An example of the variables data type is shown below: var y   
</li>
<li> Text (strings): String data types of JavaScript are a combination of multiple characters. An example of the string data type is shown below: var demoString = "Hello World"</li>
<li>Operations: Operations in JavaScript can also be assigned to JavaScript variables. An example of these is shown below: var sum = 20 + 30 + 29 </li>
<li>Boolean values: Boolean values can be true or false. An example of the boolean data type is shown below: var booleanValue = true </li>
<li> Constant numbers: As the name suggests, these data types have a fixed value. An example of the constant data type is shown below: const g = 9.8</li>
<li>Objects: JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties. They possess their own data members and methods. An example of the objects data type is shown below:
    var name = {name:"Jon Snow", id:"AS123"} </li>
</ul>
<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">JavaScript Operators</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;"> You can use variables to conduct a variety of tasks using JavaScript operators. The various types of operators in JavaScript are as follows:</p>
<ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
<li><b>Fundamental Operators</b>: These operators are used to perform basic operations like addition, multiplication, etc. in JavaScript. A list of all the Fundamental operators in JavaScript is as follows:</li>
<ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
<li>
    +: The Addition Operator is used to add two numbers
</li>
<li>-: The Subtraction Operator is used to subtract two numbers</li>
<li>*: The MultiplicationOperator is used to multiply two numbers </li>
<li>/: The Division Operator is used to divide two numbers</li>
<li>(...): In general, operations within brackets are executed earlier than that outside. This grouping operator surrounds an expression or sub-expression with a pair of parentheses to override the conventional operator precedence, allowing operators with lower precedence to be evaluated before operators with higher precedence. It does exactly what it says: it groups the contents of the parentheses.</li>
<li>%: The Modulus operator is used to get the remainder when an integer number is divided by another integer number.</li>
<li>++: The Increment operator is used to increase the value of numbers by one.</li>
<li>--: The Decrement operator is used to decrease the value of numbers by one.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; list-style: square; text-align: justify;">
   <li ><b>Bitwise Operators </b>:  All the operations dealing with the bits of the numbers can be performed by the bitwise operators in JavaScript. A list of all the Bitwise operators in JavaScript is as follows:</ul>
