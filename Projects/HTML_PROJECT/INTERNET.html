       <h2 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; margin-left: 2px;" > DEFINITION</h2>
       <p  style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">The Internet,
         sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks -- a network of
          networks in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information
           from any other computer (and sometimes talk directly to users at other computers).
            It was conceived by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. government
             in 1969 and was first known as the ARPANET. The original aim was to create a network
              that would allow users of a research computer at one university to "talk to" research
               computers at other universities. A side benefit of ARPANet's design was that, because 
               messages could be routed or rerouted in more than one direction, the network could 
               continue to function even if parts of it were destroyed in the event of a military 
               attack or other disaster.

        Today, the Internet is a public, cooperative and self-sustaining facility accessible to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. It is used by many as the primary source of information consumption, and fueled the creation and growth of its own social ecosystem through social media and content sharing. Furthermore, e-commerce, or online shopping, has become one of the largest uses of the Internet.</p>
