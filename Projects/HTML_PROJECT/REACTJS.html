    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">React Features</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">Currently, ReactJS gaining quick popularity as the best JavaScript framework among web developers. It is playing an essential role in the front-end ecosystem. The important features of ReactJS are as following.</p>  
    <ul style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
        <li>JSX</li>
      <li>Components</li>
      <li>One-way Data Binding</li>
      <li>
        Virtual DOM
      </li>
      <li>
        Simplicity
      </li>
      <li>Performance</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">JSX</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a JavaScript syntax extension. Its an XML or HTML like syntax used by ReactJS. This syntax is processed into JavaScript calls of React Framework. It extends the ES6 so that HTML like text can co-exist with JavaScript react code. It is not necessary to use JSX, but it is recommended to use in ReactJS.</p>
    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Components</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">ReactJS is all about components. ReactJS application is made up of multiple components, and each component has its own logic and controls. These components can be reusable which help you to maintain the code when working on larger scale projects.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">One-way Data Binding</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">ReactJS is designed in such a manner that follows unidirectional data flow or one-way data binding. The benefits of one-way data binding give you better control throughout the application. If the data flow is in another direction, then it requires additional features. It is because components are supposed to be immutable and the data within them cannot be changed. Flux is a pattern that helps to keep your data unidirectional. This makes the application more flexible that leads to increase efficiency.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> Virtual DOM</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">A virtual DOM object is a representation of the original DOM object. It works like a one-way data binding. Whenever any modifications happen in the web application, the entire UI is re-rendered in virtual DOM representation. Then it checks the difference between the previous DOM representation and new DOM. Once it has done, the real DOM will update only the things that have actually changed. This makes the application faster, and there is no wastage of memory.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Simplicity</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">ReactJS uses JSX file which makes the application simple and to code as well as understand. We know that ReactJS is a component-based approach which makes the code reusable as your need. This makes it simple to use and learn.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Performance</h3>

    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">ReactJS is known to be a great performer. This feature makes it much better than other frameworks out there today. The reason behind this is that it manages a virtual DOM. The DOM is a cross-platform and programming API which deals with HTML, XML or XHTML. The DOM exists entirely in memory. Due to this, when we create a component, we did not write directly to the DOM. Instead, we are writing virtual components that will turn into the DOM leading to smoother and faster performance.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Advantages of ReactJS</h3>
   <ol  style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">
   <li>Easy to Learn and Use</li>
   <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">ReactJS is much easier to learn and use. It comes with a good supply of documentation, tutorials, and training resources. Any developer who comes from a JavaScript background can easily understand and start creating web apps using React in a few days. It is the V(view part) in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model, and referred to as ?one of the JavaScript frameworks.? It is not fully featured but has the advantage of open-source JavaScript User Interface(UI) library, which helps to execute the task in a better manner.</p>
  <li>Creating Dynamic Web Applications Becomes Easier</li>
  <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">To create a dynamic web application specifically with HTML strings was tricky because it requires a complex coding, but React JS solved that issue and makes it easier. It provides less coding and gives more functionality. It makes use of the JSX(JavaScript Extension), which is a particular syntax letting HTML quotes and HTML tag syntax to render particular subcomponents. It also supports the building of machine-readable codes.</p>
   <li>Reusable Components</li> 
   <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">A ReactJS web application is made up of multiple components, and each component has its own logic and controls. These components are responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML code which can be reused wherever you need them. The reusable code helps to make your apps easier to develop and maintain. These Components can be nested with other components to allow complex applications to be built of simple building blocks. ReactJS uses virtual DOM based mechanism to fill data in HTML DOM. The virtual DOM works fast as it only changes individual DOM elements instead of reloading complete DOM every time</p>
<li>Performance Enhancement

</li>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">ReactJS improves performance due to virtual DOM. The DOM is a cross-platform and programming API which deals with HTML, XML or XHTML. Most of the developers faced the problem when the DOM was updated, which slowed down the performance of the application. ReactJS solved this problem by introducing virtual DOM. The React Virtual DOM exists entirely in memory and is a representation of the web browser's DOM. Due to this, when we write a React component, we did not write directly to the DOM. Instead, we are writing virtual components that react will turn into the DOM, leading to smoother and faster performance.</p>
<li> The Support of Handy Tools</li>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">React JS has also gained popularity due to the presence of a handy set of tools. These tools make the task of the developers understandable and easier. The React Developer Tools have been designed as Chrome and Firefox dev extension and allow you to inspect the React component hierarchies in the virtual DOM. It also allows you to select particular components and examine and edit their current props and state.</p>
<li>Known to be SEO Friendly</li>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">Traditional JavaScript frameworks have an issue in dealing with SEO. The search engines generally having trouble in reading JavaScript-heavy applications. Many web developers have often complained about this problem. ReactJS overcomes this problem that helps developers to be easily navigated on various search engines. It is because React.js applications can run on the server, and the virtual DOM will be rendering and returning to the browser as a regular web page.</p>
<li>The Benefit of Having JavaScript Library</li>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;  text-align: justify;">The Benefit of Having JavaScript Library</p>
<li>Scope for Testing the Codes</li>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">ReactJS applications are extremely easy to test. It offers a scope where the developer can test and debug their codes with the help of native tools.</p>

</ol>


<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Disadvantage of ReactJS</h3>
<ol style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">
  <li>The high pace of development</li>
  <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">The high pace of development has an advantage and disadvantage both. In case of disadvantage, since the environment continually changes so fast, some of the developers not feeling comfortable to relearn the new ways of doing things regularly. It may be hard for them to adopt all these changes with all the continuous updates. They need to be always updated with their skills and learn new ways of doing things.</p>
<li>Poor Documentation</li>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">It is another cons which are common for constantly updating technologies. React technologies updating and accelerating so fast that there is no time to make proper documentation. To overcome this, developers write instructions on their own with the evolving of new releases and tools in their current projects.</p>
<li> View Part</li>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">ReactJS Covers only the UI Layers of the app and nothing else. So you still need to choose some other technologies to get a complete tooling set for development in the project.</p>
<li> JSX as a barrier</li>
<P style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">ReactJS uses JSX. It's a syntax extension that allows HTML with JavaScript mixed together. This approach has its own benefits, but some members of the development community consider JSX as a barrier, especially for new developers. Developers complain about its complexity in the learning curve.</P>
</ol>
<hr>

<h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">React Components</h3>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">Earlier, the developers write more than thousands of lines of code for developing a single page application. These applications follow the traditional DOM structure, and making changes in them was a very challenging task. If any mistake found, it manually searches the entire application and update accordingly. The component-based approach was introduced to overcome an issue. In this approach, the entire application is divided into a small logical group of code, which is known as components.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;">A Component is considered as the core building blocks of a React application. It makes the task of building UIs much easier. Each component exists in the same space, but they work independently from one another and merge all in a parent component, which will be the final UI of your application</p>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; text-align: justify;"> Every React component have their own structure, methods as well as APIs. They can be reusable as per your need. For better understanding, consider the entire UI as a tree. Here, the root is the starting component, and each of the other pieces becomes branches, which are further divided into sub-branches.</p>
